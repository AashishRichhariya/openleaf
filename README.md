## The minimalist web-based editor

**openleaf** is a minimalist, browser-based text editor that lets you start writing instantly without signup, downloads, or configuration. Just go to any URL and start typing!

## How It Works

- Visit any link like `openleaf.xyz/anything-you-want`
- Start typing immediately
- The content automatically saves as you type
- Share the URL with others or return later to continue

## Features

### Markdown Syntax
**openleaf** supports markdown shortcuts for quick formatting (type the symbol then press space to activate):
- Type `#` for a large heading
- Type `##` for a medium heading
- Type `###` for a small heading
- Type `-` for bullet points
- Type `1.` for numbered lists
- Type `>` for blockquotes

### Command Menu
Press `/` to access the command menu with all available formatting options:
- Headings (3 levels)
- Lists (numbered, bulleted, checklist)
- Tables
- Quotes
- Code blocks (coming soon!)
- Text alignment (coming soon!)
- And more!

### Tables
Create tables easily by either:
- Type `/table` and select from the menu
- Or type `/NxM` where N and M are any numbers (like `/3x4`, `/2x6`, etc.) to instantly create a table with that many rows and columns

### Checklists
Keep track of tasks with checkable lists:
- [x] Create a minimalist editor
- [x] Make it work without signup with a simple url
- [x] Add Markdown support
- [x] Add table support
- [x] Open-source it
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Add more features!

## Philosophy

**openleaf** is designed with simplicity in mind:
 > The best tool is the one that gets out of your way. 

The goal is to provide a writing space that's instantly available when needed, without barriers or complexity. Sometimes all you need is a quick place to jot down thoughts or draft something up.

## Privacy & Security

By design, **openleaf** is open and accessible. This means:
- Anyone with the URL can view and edit your content
- Nothing is private by default
- Choose obscure URLs for reduced discoverability
- Don't store sensitive information
- For extra security, clear the editor content after you're done if you don't want others to access it later

## Use Cases

### Perfect for:
- Quick notes while browsing
- Drafting emails or messages
- Temporary information sharing
- Collaborative brainstorming
- Instant document creation

### Not ideal for:
- Private/confidential information
- Long-term document storage

## Project Status

**openleaf** is currently in beta with known bugs and limitations. Development continues as time permits, with priority given to critical issues and frequently requested features. Please use the GitHub repository to report any bugs you encounter.
