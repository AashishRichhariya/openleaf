## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs:

- Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Use a clear title and description
- Include steps to reproduce
- Mention your browser and OS
- Include screenshots or screen recordings when relevant

### Suggesting Features

For feature requests:

- Explain why the feature would be useful
- Keep it aligned with openleaf's philosophy
- Consider providing mockups or examples

### Branch Naming & Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch following our naming convention:
   - All lowercase with hyphens between words
   - For features: `feature/short-description` (e.g., `feature/code-blocks`)
   - For bugfixes: `bugfix/short-description` (e.g., `bugfix/table-alignment`)
   - For documentation: `docs/short-description` (e.g., `docs/api-reference`)
   - For maintenance tasks: `chore/short-description` (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
   - For refactoring: `refactor/short-description` (e.g., `refactor/editor-state`)
   - For testing: `test/short-description` (e.g., `test/table-rendering`)
   - For style changes: `style/short-description` (e.g., `style/button-colors`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a PR to the `develop` branch (not directly to `main`)

## Code Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense and imperative mood
- Keep the first line short (< 72 characters)
- Format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(editor): add code block support`)

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Use ESLint and Prettier for formatting (configs are in the repo)
- For CSS, use Tailwind utility classes when possible
